              Microsoft Flight Simulator (often abbreviated as MSFS, 
              MFS or FS) is a series of amateur flight simulator 
              programs for Microsoft Windows operating systems, and 
              earlier for MS-DOS and Classic Mac OS. It is one of the 
              longest-running, best-known, and most comprehensive home 
              flight simulator programs on the market. It was an early 
              product in the Microsoft application portfolio and 
              differed significantly from Microsoft's other software, 
              which was largely business-oriented. At 39 years old, 
              it is the longest-running software product line for 
              Microsoft, predating Windows by three years. Microsoft 
              Flight Simulator is one of the longest-running PC video 
              game series of all time.
