              <strong>Description:</strong></br></br>
              Humankind is a 4X game comparable to the Civilization 
              series. Players lead their civilization across six major 
              eras of human civilization, starting from the nomadic 
              age, directing how the civilization should expand, 
              developing cities, controlling military and other types of 
              units as they interact with other civilizations on the 
              virtual planet, randomly generated at the start of a new 
              game. A distinguishing feature of Humankind is that within 
              each of the eras, the player selects one of ten civilization 
              types based on historical societies; this selection offers 
              both bonuses and penalties to how the player can build out 
              the civilization. Because a player can select different 
              civilizations as templates to build upon, there exist 
              potentially one million different civilization patterns that 
              a player can ultimately develop.
